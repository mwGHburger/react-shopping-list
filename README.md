# Simple-React-Shopping-List

This a simple shopping list app created with the React library. It allows users to add, delete and like shopping-list items.

## Motivation

I created this little project for myself to see whether or not I can build something simple using React. It is purely made for educational purposes; helping to consolidate knowledge of React concepts and its component-based architecture.
